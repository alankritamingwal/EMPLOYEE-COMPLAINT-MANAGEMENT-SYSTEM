# EMPLOYEE COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# PROJECT BACKGROUND
Employee satisfaction and well-being play a crucial role in the success of any 
organization, including colleges. A harmonious work environment is essential for 
fostering productivity, collaboration, and innovation. However, it is inevitable that 
employee grievances and complaints may arise from time to time. These complaints 
could range from issues related to workplace conditions, unfair treatment, harassment, or 
other concerns.
To ensure a fair and efficient resolution of employee complaints, colleges need a robust 
and systematic approach to complaint management. Traditional methods relying on 
manual processes, paper-based forms, and fragmented communication channels often 
result in delays, miscommunication, and a lack of transparency. This is where an 
Employee Complaint Management System (ECMS) can make a significant difference.
The ECMS is a software solution specifically designed to streamline and automate the 
process of managing employee complaints within a college environment. It serves as a 
centralized platform that facilitates the submission, tracking, and resolution of 
complaints, enabling college administrators to address grievances promptly.

# PORTAL DESCRIPTION 
The implementation of ECMS portal is divided into three parts which includes:
1. Admin:-
 1.1 Login page
 1.2 Admin Dashboard
2. User:-
 2.1 User Registration
 2.2 User profile
 2.3. Register complaint
 2.4  user dashboard
3. Database

# PROPOSED WORK
# HOMEPAGE
1. In order for our application to work, we first navigate through homepage.
2. In our application, we have two portals i.e Admin and User. In Admin, all the complaints 
of users are managed. On the other hand, User portal is used for registering the 
complaints.
